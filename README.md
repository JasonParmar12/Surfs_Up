## Overview of the Analysis
Using advanced data storage and retrieval in order to effectively provide an analysis of temperatures on the island of Oahu. The months of July and December were of main focus to us in order to determine the viability of operating a proposed surf and ice cream shop business.

## Results
- Average temperature recorded in June is about 75 degrees. The average temperature in December is 71 degrees. Thus, there is roughly a 4 degree variation from July to December in temperature.
- The standard deviation is higher in December. The maximum and minimum temperatures vary more greatly in the month of December in comparison to July. In December temperatures range from a minimum of 53 degrees to a maximum of 83 whereas in July the minimum is 64 and the maximum is 85. This is not a drastic shift in temperature. 

## Summary 
After analyzing the trends in temperature on Oahu for July and December, it has become evident that both months experience similar weather. Although the minimum of december is roughly 11 degrees colder than the minimum of July both their averages and maximum temperatures are close to each other. Given this information I think that it is feasible to operate the surf and ice cream shop year round in Oahu.
